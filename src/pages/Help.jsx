Our approach involves conducting live online classes through direct interaction between students and teachers, rather than relying on pre-recorded videos. Our online live classes create an engaging environment where students can interact with both other students and our industry-experienced mentors, who provide invaluable insights and guidance. We prioritize hands-on practice during the classes and offer class videos and PDF notes at the conclusion of each session. In case you miss any context, you can refer to the class videos for further practice.

The integration of academic education with job market knowledge is essential. It is important to combine theoretical knowledge gained through academic studies with practical skills and understanding of the job market. This integration allows individuals to develop a well-rounded skill set that aligns with the needs and demands of the professional world.

Academic education provides a foundation of theoretical concepts, critical thinking abilities, and analytical skills. It equips individuals with a deep understanding of their chosen field and prepares them for various challenges they may encounter in their careers. However, academic education alone may not be sufficient to thrive in the job market.

Job market knowledge complements academic education by offering insights into the current trends, industry-specific skills, and practical experiences required for specific roles. It helps individuals bridge the gap between theoretical knowledge. We help individuals prepare as skilled and competent candidates to secure jobs by integrating their academic or self-learning with market knowledge. In addition to that, we provide guidance on real code tests, mock interviews, career guidance, writing standard resumes/CVs, creating LinkedIn profiles, and building networks.
